# Football and Weather
This project is aimed at determining if a win can be predicted based upon the weather at the game. We will also consider the average score depending on the weather. 

I found the data of all games from 2009 to 2018 on the website: http://www.nflweather.com/. We will first investigate the SuperBowl 50 Champions, the Denver Broncos. 

## During  EDA I found:
The total games in my data set were 210. 
The average temperature of the games was 62 degrees Farenheit.
The winning rate was 0.54 (113/210).

## Statistical Test Elements:
1. H_0: The winning rate is 0.54, no matter the temperature
2. H_A: The winning rate will increase or decrease, DEPENDING on the temperature
3. The statistical test I will use is a Bonferroni Test
4. Since this is a two tailed test (checking for lower or higher temperatures) I will have an alpha level at 0.025.
