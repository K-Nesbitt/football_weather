# Football and Weather
This project is aimed at determining if a win can be predicted based upon the weather at the game. We will also consider the average score depending on the weather. 

I found the data of all games from 2009 to 2018 on the website: http://www.nflweather.com/. We will first investigate the SuperBowl 50 Champions, the Denver Broncos.
